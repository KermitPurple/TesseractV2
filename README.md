# Tesseract

This is my second attempt at a tesseract problem. My first attempt I used 3D points because I lacked the fundemental understanding of what a hypercube was. After research, I have taken my work from my previous attempt and successfully finished this rendering application. the [The freeGLUT library](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) was used.
